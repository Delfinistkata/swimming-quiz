# Swimming Quiz

pic..

Swimming is a popular recreational activity, sport, and form of exercise that involves propelling oneself through water using the arms and legs. It is a low-impact workout that offers numerous health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health, increased muscular strength and endurance, and enhanced flexibility and range of motion. Swimming is also a lifesaving skill that can prevent drowning and other water-related accidents.
The swimming quiz is a test of knowledge and proficiency in various aspects of swimming, such as swimming strokes, techniques, rules, and safety measures. It includes multiple-choice questions. The quiz may be taken by beginners or experienced swimmers and covers topics such as freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and flip turns. The purpose of the quiz is to assess one's knowledge and understanding of swimming and to promote safe and effective swimming practices.

[Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) has been used to apply color to the terminal text and the logo,
in order to make it more intuitive and easier to read.

* Correct answers are in green colour.
* The logo of the game is in blue with white background colour.

### Flowchart

<br>

[Lucid](https://www.lucid.app/) has been used to create a simple flowchart of the expected flow of logic through the programme from start to finish. This helped me to visualise the structure of the code and what functions may be needed.

As shown in the flowchart, the original order of some functions has been changed during the development process in order to follow a more intuitive logic and sequence of events but the main idea behind the process is still the same.
